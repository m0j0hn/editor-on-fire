EOF is a song editor for Frets On Fire, Phase Shift, Rock Band and Rocksmith. The aim of EOF is to provide a simple process with which to create songs. Just provide an OGG file and spend a little time designing note charts and EOF will save files in the appropriate format for immediate use with Frets on Fire and Phase Shift, no additional steps or conversions necessary!  Or, with some more work, it will be usable in Rock Band or Rocksmith.

The last official, stable binary releases are available in the downloads section.  Newer beta builds are available here:
